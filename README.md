# About-Me
Hello, I'm Alex, an up and coming Full-Stack Developer. I am currently attending the U.C. Berkeley Extension Full-time Full-Stack Flex Boot Camp. At my current stage, I have been able to show my competency in completing an assortment of different assignments, each highlighting my proficiency on the programming languages and additional javascript libraries that I can use.

As of now, I am highly proficient in the usage of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am also experienced at using the many javascript libaries such as jQuery to strengthen the functionality of my projects. I have also mastered using third party api's to draw data from numerous sources and implement the drawn data into my projects as well.

Recently I have stepped into creating full-stack applications and have deployed a few of my projects on Heroku. I am able to create RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express. I have set up databases using MySQL and the Sequelize ORM and rendered data drawn from my models into handlebar views.
